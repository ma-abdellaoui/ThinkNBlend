# Quality Assessment Proposal for ThinkNBlend

## 1. Visual Realism Assessment

### 1.1 Automated Metrics

**Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)**

- **Purpose**: Measure the distance between real and generated image distributions
- **Implementation**: Compare FID scores between original COCO images and ThinkNBlend outputs
- **Target**: FID < 50 for high-quality results
- **Formula**: FID = ||μ_r - μ_g||² + Tr(Σ_r + Σ_g - 2(Σ_r Σ_g)^(1/2))

**LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity)**

- **Purpose**: Measure perceptual similarity between original and modified images
- **Implementation**: Compare LPIPS scores for object insertion regions
- **Target**: LPIPS < 0.1 for seamless blending
- **Advantage**: More robust than pixel-wise metrics

**CLIPScore**

- **Purpose**: Evaluate semantic consistency between text prompts and generated images
- **Implementation**: Score alignment between insertion descriptions and final outputs
- **Target**: CLIPScore > 0.7 for good semantic alignment

### 1.2 Human Evaluation Metrics

**Realism Rating Scale (1-5)**

- 1: Obviously fake, clear artifacts
- 2: Somewhat fake, noticeable issues
- 3: Neutral, neither obviously real nor fake
- 4: Realistic, minor issues
- 5: Highly realistic, indistinguishable from real

**Blending Quality Assessment**

- Seamless integration with background
- Consistent lighting and shadows
- Proper perspective alignment
- Color harmony with scene

### 1.3 Implementation Plan

```python
def assess_visual_realism(generated_images, reference_images):
    # FID calculation
    fid_score = calculate_fid(generated_images, reference_images)

    # LPIPS calculation
    lpips_scores = [calculate_lpips(gen, ref) for gen, ref in zip(generated_images, reference_images)]

    # CLIPScore calculation
    clip_scores = [calculate_clip_score(gen, prompt) for gen, prompt in zip(generated_images, prompts)]

    return {
        'fid_score': fid_score,
        'avg_lpips': np.mean(lpips_scores),
        'avg_clip_score': np.mean(clip_scores)
    }
```

## 2. Label Accuracy Assessment

- **Implementation**: Compare predicted vs. actual bounding boxes
- **Metrics**: IoU (Intersection over Union), Center Distance
- **Target**: IoU > 0.7, Center Distance < 10% of image size

### 2.2 Text Recognition Verification

**OCR Accuracy**

- **Purpose**: Verify that inserted text is readable and accurate
- **Implementation**: Use EasyOCR, Tesseract, or commercial OCR APIs

    # Text recognition verification
    ocr_results = run_ocr(generated_images)
    cer, wer = calculate_text_metrics(ocr_results, ground_truth_text)

    return {
        'object_detection_map': map_score,
        'object_detection_precision': precision,
        'object_detection_recall': recall,

    # Scene diversity
    scene_complexity = analyze_scene_complexity(generated_dataset)

    # Text diversity
    text_lengths = extract_text_lengths(generated_dataset)
    text_style_diversity = analyze_text_styles(generated_dataset)

    return {
        'category_diversity': category_diversity,
        'scene_complexity_variance': np.var(scene_complexity),
        'text_length_variance': np.var(text_lengths),
