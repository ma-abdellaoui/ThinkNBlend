# ThinkNBlend 🧠🎨
**Context-aware object insertion with multimodal reasoning, zero-shot detection, and Stable Diffusion blending.**

`ThinkNBlend` is a pipeline that intelligently inserts objects into real-world images using language-guided spatial reasoning and diffusion-based visual synthesis. The system leverages GPT-4 for high-level scene analysis, zero-shot detection for reference localization, and Stable Diffusion inpainting for seamless visual blending.

## 🔍 Features

- 🤖 **GPT-4-Powered Scene Understanding:** Extracts context, object semantics, and ideal placement zones from image + object inputs.
- 🧭 **Zero-Shot Object Referencing:** Uses a zero-shot object detection model to detect reference points for spatial anchoring.
- 🖼️ **Stable Diffusion Blending:** Synthesizes and blends inserted objects naturally using pre-trained inpainting models.
- 🪄 **Fully Automated:** From input image and object crop to final augmented image — no manual labels or masks needed.
- 📦 **Modular Pipeline:** Each component (reasoning, detection, insertion, blending) is swappable and extensible.

## 🗂️ Inputs & Outputs

### Inputs:
- `source_image.jpg`: The primary image (e.g., COCO-style scene).
- `object_crop.jpg`: Small image crop of the object to be inserted.

### Output:
- `blended_output.jpg`: Final image with the object inserted naturally in context.
- `description.json`: Structured description of the scene and insertion plan (from GPT-4).
- *(optional)* visualization overlays of reference detections and masks.
